# WordleBot
An overly-complicated wordle solver

A wordle script that uses letter frequency and bigram frequency based on position. Runs locally at a decently fast speed. 

Todo:
1. Add selenium webdriver to automatically solve wordle puzzles
2. Assess accuracy and speed 
3. Organize project files and clean code
